As his first experience in the field (in Business Intelligence), Olivier worked as a Big Data Analyst using tools such as Hadoop and Spark. In 2015 the focus changed to traditional data warehousing & reporting using SSIS, SSRS & MicroStrategy. A bit later, around June 2019, the opportunity arose to fill the position of BI Teamlead. In this function he was able to set up a hybrid BI Team (team members in Belgium and Belarus). Early 2020, Olivier joined the dataMinds crew as a core member, assisting to organise several events. Around April 2021, Olivier started a new position as BI Teamlead in another Retail Company to support business growth. Besides the challenge to help the BI Team grow and deliver projects on time, he started to use SSAS & Power BI. In April 2025, Olivier stepped away from internal positions and became an independent consultant.

Aspiring to be top notch in his field, through continuous personal development, on both technical and soft skills. He strives for maximum results in his tasks using team play, communication, thinking outside of the box, and (endless) motivation. Benni is always ready to tackle the unknown, or pick up fresh ideas to broaden his range. Building on past experiences, he continuously tries to find new, more efficient ways of obtaining results, and improving the process along the way. Loving (almost) every day of it, he's fascinated by the value of data, sometimes flabbergasted by the lack of awareness, and intrigued by the endless possibilities whilst discovering new ways of looking at data. He thrives on unfolding new insights for customers whilst using an open and transparent communication. On a daily basis he turns (large amounts of) coffee into insights for customers, and references witty British comedy, lame dad jokes, and obscure facts way too often. Overly enthusiastic about anything data related, he's trying hard to keep up with all things new and shiny. When not working, blogging or reading, you'll likely find him out and about being his weird self. Rumour has it that he's also involved with a ragtag band of data enthusiasts, enjoying themselves whilst organising cool community things.

    "answer": "Katharina Covadonga Clören - Data Analytics Consultant @ORAYLIS GmbH\n\nHi there, my name is Katharina Covadonga Clören. I discovered my passion for data analysis and reporting during my studies – quite unexpectedly, in a student job. That's when I realized how much I enjoy analyzing complex patterns and bringing them to life through creative visuals. For me, data visualization is the perfect blend of analytical detective and creative artist: I love uncovering hidden insights and presenting them in a way that's clear, engaging, and impactful. For the past two years, I've been working as a consultant with a focus on Data Analytics and Data Storytelling. What fascinates me most is the incredible potential and variety that lies in good visualizations. Before starting my consulting career, I spent a year traveling around the world – driven by curiosity, a love for adventure, and an open mind for people, cultures, and new perspectives. That same openness shapes the way I work today: Data is everywhere, and it always tells a story – you just have to listen (and look) closely. When I'm not building reports or analyzing data, you'll find me doing yoga, bouldering, enjoying food from around the world, or exploring the planet.\n\nSpeaking at: \"Data Storytelling - a new hope for your data\" at 15:15.",
