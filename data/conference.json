For me, data visualization is the perfect blend of analytical detective and creative artist: I love uncovering hidden insights and presenting them in a way that's clear, engaging, and impactful. For the past two years, I've been working as a consultant with a focus on Data Analytics and Data Storytelling. What fascinates me most is the incredible potential and variety that lies in good visualizations. Before starting my consulting career, I spent a year traveling around the world – driven by curiosity, a love for adventure, and an open mind for people, cultures, and new perspectives. That same openness shapes the way I work today: Data is everywhere, and it always tells a story – you just have to listen (and look) closely. When I'm not building reports or analyzing data, you'll find me doing yoga, bouldering, enjoying food from around the world, or exploring the planet.",
